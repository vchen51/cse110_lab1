Hi there! I'm a student programmer at UCSD studying _Mathematics - Computer Science_ as a second year. I am currently taking **CSE 110** in hopes to achieve my goal into becoming a developer and learn as much as I can. 

## My favorite things

My favorite programming joke is
> Why do Computer Science students need glasses?
> To C#

My favorite language is 
> Java, because it's the only thing I have formally learned :)

I like looking at code with white spaces but find it a hassle to actually write it
`white_space( whitespace )`
